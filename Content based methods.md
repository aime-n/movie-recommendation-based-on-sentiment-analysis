[[Recommendation System]]
# Content based methods
- has model

It uses interactions and additional info (content) about user and/or item.
It tries to build a model that predict similarities based on features (content) and interactions.

Advantage over collaborative filtering method = it also uses features, not only interactions. then it doesn't have that cold start problem. Once the recommendation system is old enough, it handles well even new info (unseen feature) of users/items.
