## 2) Model based approaches
tries to model a ==generative model on user-item interactions== to make new predictions.
- user-item interaction
- it has a latent model, so, theoretically it has a bigger bias (model per se)  and a lower variance
- small dense vectors
ex: matrix factorisation

> The users and items latent representations extracted by the model have a mathematical meaning that can be hard to interpret for a human being. 
\- Towards Data Science

### Matrix factorisation
huge user-item matrix becames a product of two smaller matrices: user-factor and factor-item.

- the system learns by itself useful features throught mathematical reasoning.

#### Maths behind it
